/*created 3 independent nodes using the function Node which takes in the value as 3, 5 and 7 respectively and the next pointer is undefined for the node n3
Note: declaration of var n1 = new node(3,n2); var n2= new node(5,n3); will give undefined because n1 will not have access to n2 and n2 to n3 hence declare n3 first
